# Xkaliber Agent v37 Changelog

## [37.9.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **Silent Agent Bug**: Fixed a payload cloning logic error where the agent would only receive the system prompt and ignore user instructions when "Resource Saver" was enabled.
- **Missing Chat History**: Resolved the critical bug where Task Isolation was overwriting and wiping the UI chat history from disk. Legacy history files (v33, v34, etc.) now automatically migrate and restore upon startup.

### Changed
- **High-Contrast Chat Bubbles**: Redesigned the chat message bubbles to use a classic Light Mode aesthetic (pure black text on light grey bubbles) while maintaining the app's overall dark theme. This permanently eliminates the visual blooming/halation effect that made light text on dark backgrounds look faint.

## [37.9.0] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed
- **UI Readability**: Significantly increased the brightness of the default text, labels, and system messages (changed from faded grey to pure white and light grey) and increased font weight to `500` to prevent text from looking faded or hard to read against the dark theme.

## [37.8.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Offline Browser Responsiveness**: Resolved a visual bug where AI-generated websites lacked layout boundaries, causing text and tables to overflow horizontally off the screen.
  - *Details*: The renderer now automatically prepends a robust baseline CSS wrapper to the Shadow DOM. This enforces `box-sizing: border-box`, `word-wrap: break-word`, and `max-width: 100%` on all generated elements, ensuring perfect readability regardless of how the AI writes its internal CSS. Also added horizontal scroll fallback for unbreakable `<pre>` code blocks.

## [37.7.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Ollama Offline Browser Rendering**: Fixed a bug where enabling Offline Web Browser mode while connected to Ollama resulted in a blank white chat bubble.
  - *Details*: The stream parser now dynamically checks for both `json.message.content` (used by Ollama's `/api/chat` endpoint) and `json.response` (used by Ollama's `/api/generate` endpoint) when piping HTML directly into the Shadow DOM.

## [37.6.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Offline Web Browser Mode**: Introduced a new toggle that transforms the chat UI into an offline browser. 
  - When enabled, the agent no longer responds in natural language. Instead, it generates a complete, beautifully styled HTML5 webpage (mimicking a Wikipedia article, tech blog, or application interface) based on your query.
  - The generated webpage is securely rendered directly inside the chat using an isolated Shadow DOM, preventing CSS conflicts with the main application UI while allowing a rich, native browsing experience.

## [37.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Task Isolation Mode (Ultra-Aggressive Pruning)**: Implemented a strict memory management policy. When "Resource Saver" is enabled, sending a new message will now completely flush all previous conversational history from the model's memory (while retaining the system prompt). 
  - *Why*: This ensures that 100% of your Context Window and VRAM are dedicated *exclusively* to the current coding task and its associated tool outputs, preventing massive context bloat from breaking LM Studio.
- **UI Consistency Fix**: Fixed a visual bug where the application title bar incorrectly displayed `v36.4` instead of the current version.

## [37.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Hallucination Loop / Context Cutoff Trap**: Fixed a critical bug where hitting the context limit in LM Studio would trigger an endless cycle of partial generations.
  - Previously, if the context window was filled while the agent was writing code, LM Studio would stop mid-tool-call. The broken JSON triggered the agent's "Hallucination Guard Rail", which nudged the model to try again with the same broken context, leading to infinite reprocessing.
  - **Context Cutoff Detector**: The stream parser now intercepts `finish_reason: length`. If the model is cut off due to context bounds, the autonomous loop instantly pauses and provides a clear red warning to the user, completely preventing the endless retries.
  - **Deep-Cache Pruning**: When the chat history breaches optimal limits, the Context Guard now prunes 50% of the older messages in a single batch, rather than 1 message per turn. This drastically reduces the number of times the LM Studio Prompt Cache is invalidated during long tasks.
  - Added explicit `max_tokens: -1` to the LM Studio payload to prevent artificial early cutoffs.

## [37.3.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **LM Studio Context Thrashing**: Fixed a critical issue where the agent's autonomous task payload would grow beyond LM Studio's configured context window, triggering LM Studio's internal "rolling window" policy. This caused the prompt cache to invalidate mid-generation, resulting in endless "Processing Prompt..." delays and extreme task times.
  - **Context Window Guard**: The agent now mathematically binds the chat history payload to 75% of the Context Size slider setting when using LM Studio mode. This guarantees a 25% VRAM headroom for the model's actual response, fully bypassing the internal rolling window thrashing effect.

## [37.2.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Mid-Generation VRAM Flushes**: Resolved the persistent "Model timed out" error caused by Ollama silently paging out the model *during* active multi-turn tasks. 
  - **Generation Lock**: Implemented a `keep_alive: -1` lock during the active 20-turn task loop. This prevents long-running tool executions (like compiling code) from triggering Ollama's auto-unload timeout.
  - **Post-Task Cleanup**: Re-architected `pageOutModel` and the cleanup routines. The system now safely respects the "Resource Saver" 1-minute timeout *only* after the full autonomous task has completely finished.

## [37.0.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Model Timeout on Reload**: Resolved the persistent "Model timed out" error that occurred after a successful VRAM flush. 
  - **Dynamic Timeout**: Increased the "Time-To-First-Token" (TTFT) timeout threshold to 15 minutes to allow large models sufficient time to reload into VRAM and process heavy context windows.
  - **Status Indicator**: Added a specific "Warming up model and processing context..." UI indicator so users know the agent is actively working and hasn't frozen.

## [36.4.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Predictive Resource Guard**: Real-time system monitoring that detects RAM and VRAM congestion before it causes a crash.
- **Adaptive Context Sliding Window**: Automatically shrinks the conversation history and increases truncation intensity when high resource pressure is detected.
- **Visual Resource Gauge**: Added a real-time status indicator (dot) in the header to monitor system health.
- **Aggressive Garbage Collection**: Proactive memory cleanup triggered by the backend during intensive autonomous tasks.

### Fixed
- **Large-Scale Generation Hangs**: Resolved "Stream timeout" errors during multi-turn coding tasks by aggressively managing context between turns.
- **VRAM Congestion Recovery**: Improved the 5-minute timeout handler to provide clearer feedback and better recovery options.

## [36.3.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Intelligent Resource Manager**: Introduced a multi-layered memory management system to prevent system RAM and VRAM congestion during complex autonomous tasks.
- **Dynamic Context Pruning**: Automatically trims extremely large messages and prunes intermediate conversation history when "Resource Saver" mode is enabled.
- **Memory Purge Tool**: Equipped the agent with the `memory_purge` capability, allowing it to autonomously request a resource cleanup when performing intensive operations (e.g., app generation).
- **Resource Saver Toggle**: Added a dedicated UI toggle to enable/disable aggressive memory optimizations.
- **Ollama Keep-Alive Optimization**: Automatically adjusts model `keep_alive` duration based on Resource Saver status to free VRAM faster.

### Fixed
- **System RAM Congestion**: Resolved issues where long-running autonomous tasks would max out system RAM by bloating the chat history.
- **VRAM Exhaustion Deadlocks**: Improved model paging and relief delays to prevent application hangs on hardware with limited VRAM.

## [36.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **🛡️ Secure Authentication**: Introduced a robust multi-user login system to protect agent access.
  - **Encrypted Storage**: Secure password hashing using `bcrypt`.
  - **Permission Tiers**: Role-based access control (Admin/User) to manage system tool permissions.
  - **Session Security**: Secure token-based session management.
- **📎 Enhanced File Attachments**:
  - **Vision Support**: Automatic base64 encoding for images, enabling multimodal analysis with vision-capable models.
  - **Smart Text Extraction**: Automated content extraction for text-based attachments.
  - **Context Protection**: Intelligent truncation of large files to prevent context window overflow, with instructions for the agent to use `read_file` for full access.
  - **UI Stability**: Fixed silent failures and added explicit error reporting for failed attachments.

## [36.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Asynchronous Background Processing**: Upgraded the `run_shell_command` tool to use `spawn` instead of `execSync` when `is_background` is set. This prevents long-running tasks (e.g., kernel builds, model training) from triggering timeouts or hitting output buffer limits.
- **Process Log Tailing**: Added a new `read_process_log` tool allowing the agent to tail the live output (`stdout`/`stderr`) of background jobs without overwhelming the LLM's context window.
- **Interactive Shell Input**: Added a new `send_input` tool, allowing the agent to pipe text directly to the `stdin` of a running background process. This solves the issue of commands hanging while waiting for user confirmation (e.g., `[Y/n]`).

# Xkaliber Agent v35 Changelog

## [35.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Integration**: Implemented secure remote access out-of-the-box. The application now automatically downloads `cloudflared` and sets up an ephemeral tunnel, exposing a public URL so users can access their local agent from anywhere.
- **Standalone Server Enhancements**: The headless `standalone-server.js` now fully supports Cloudflare Tunnel generation for easy CLI hosting.

### Fixed
- **Agent Path Expansion**: Fixed an issue where the embedded agent's internal filesystem tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `delete_file`, `list_directory`) failed when parsing paths containing the tilde (`~`) character. Added proper resolution to the user's home directory.
- **Packaging Crash**: Resolved a `SyntaxError` caused by a duplicate `os` module declaration that prevented `.AppImage` and `.deb` builds from launching.

  - **Diagnostic Commands**: Added `ghosttrace run` for generating test reports and `ghosttrace export <run_id>` for generating redacted `.zip` debug bundles.
  - **Pervasive Instrumentation**: Woven into the core chat pipelines for both Electron UI and CLI apps to monitor input, context loading, model capability routing, generation, tool execution, and output.
  - **Privacy Enforcement**: Hard-coded regex scrubbers guarantee that secrets (e.g., API keys, GitHub tokens) are stripped from human-readable reports and export bundles.

# Xkaliber Agent v30.5 Changelog

## [30.5.0] - 2025-09-03

### Enhanced
- **Web Search Presentation**: Completely refactored how web search results are processed and presented.
  - **Natural Language Narrative**: The agent is now instructed to present all search findings as a cohesive, first-person narrative (e.g., "I found that...").
  - **Anti-Clutter Directives**: Explicitly prohibited the use of bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown tables for search results to ensure a clean, conversational flow.
  - **Narrative Tool Output**: Modified the `web_search` tool to return information in a narrative paragraph format, guiding the model toward the desired conversational style.
- **Builds**: Generated updated standalone executables for v30.5.0.
  - Packaged as `.AppImage` for portable Linux deployment.
  - Packaged as `.deb` for Debian/Ubuntu based systems.

# Xkaliber Agent v30.4 Changelog

## [30.4.0] - 2026-06-30

### Enhanced
- **Prompt Architecture**: Re-instated explicit `GUARD RAILS` in the core system prompt to strictly prevent tool call hallucinations and unprompted system modifications.
- **Narrative Enforcement**: Hardened the system instructions to ensure conversational, non-structured outputs (essays/news reports) when handling web data. The AI is now strictly forbidden from utilizing markdown tables, lists, or bolded headers during web search context generation.
- **Memory Tool Constraints**: Drastically reduced aggressive memory saves. The `save_new_user_fact_only` tool schema and system prompts have been heavily constrained to ignore casual conversation and greetings, triggering only on highly important, permanent facts.

### Removed
- **Live Summary**: Removed the experimental "Live Summary" instruction from the web search prompt as it was causing conversational flow issues and bleeding into casual queries.

## [30.3.0] - 2026-06-30

### Enhanced
- **Web Search Consolidation**: Search results are now synthesized into a single, organized summary rather than individual statements.
- **Search Result Limit**: Set to a balanced limit of 6 results per query.
- **Improved Context Injection**: Directives added to both user prompts and system prompts to enforce synthesized, cited responses.
- **Robust Scraper**: Better HTML entity handling for cleaner data extraction.

## [30.2.0] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **Hardware Guard Reset (VRAM Lock):** Fixed an issue where the Emergency Reset button aggressively killed Ollama (`kill -9`), causing the AMD ROCm/NVIDIA GPU driver to lock the VRAM and requiring a full PC reboot.
  - Implemented a graceful shutdown sequence (`kill -15` with a timeout) to allow models to cleanly deallocate VRAM.
  - Added support for automatically executing `systemctl restart ollama` to guarantee a clean state if the user has provided a Sudo Password in the UI.

## [30.0.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **🛡️ Hardware Guard Implementation:**
  - Real-time VRAM and System RAM telemetry monitor in the sidebar.
  - Interactive GPU load tracking for both AMD and NVIDIA hardware.
  - **Emergency Hardware Reset:** One-click feature to kill unresponsive AI backends (Ollama/LMS) and relaunch the agent.
  - **Watchdog Alert System:** Proactive notifications when the AI backend stops responding, often due to VRAM exhaustion.
- **Improved Telemetry Support:** Added AMD `sysfs` detection for VRAM and GPU utilization as a primary telemetry source.
- **Safe State Migration:** Automated migration of session history from v29 to v30.

## [29.0.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Neural-Core Guard Rails:** Implemented advanced protection against tool call hallucinations.
  - Added real-time validation of tool names and argument schemas before execution.
  - Implemented an interception layer that detects unknown or malformed tool calls and automatically nudges the model to ask the user for clarification.
  - Updated System Prompt with strict directives to prioritize user clarification over guessing when uncertain.
- **Improved Versioning:** Synchronized application versioning to v29 across all components including UI, CLI, and persistent storage.

### Fixed
- **UI Crash:** Fixed a critical syntax error in the core system prompt generation that caused the UI thread to crash on startup, preventing model connection and history loading.
- **Chat History Migration:** Fixed an issue where the chat history would appear blank on first launch of v29. Added fallback logic to seamlessly migrate legacy session history into the new v29 format.
- **Unprompted Actions:** Strengthened System Prompt guard rails to strictly prohibit the model from creating files, configurations, or examples unless explicitly commanded by the user, preventing over-eager tool hallucinations.

## [28.0.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Enhanced support for AMD ROCm and NVIDIA GPUs on Linux.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Improved VRAM management and tool execution speed.

## [27.0.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Dynamic Schemas:** Added support for generating dynamic tool schemas on the fly.
- **Vector Memory v27:** Upgraded persistent vector memory database for better retrieval performance.

# Xkaliber Agent v26 Changelog


## [26.0.0] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **LM Studio Tool Results Bug:** Fixed an issue where the agent would fail to provide results after a web search until the user prompted it a second time.
  - Implemented persistent Tool Call IDs in the chat history to prevent context mismatch during agent loops.
  - Improved OpenAI-format message reconstruction for LM Studio, ensuring assistant messages use valid content fields when tool calls are present.
  - Added an autonomous "nudge" mechanism that detects when a model is silent after receiving tool results and automatically prompts for the final answer.

## [25.0.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **LM Studio Support:** Integrated support for LM Studio (Uplink) alongside Ollama, allowing for high-performance inference with OpenAI-compatible tool calling.

# Xkaliber Agent v24 Changelog

## [24.0.0] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **TTS Critical Crash:** Fixed a recurring issue where the Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine would crash the Electron main process with a "JavaScript error occurred in main process" message.
  - Implemented robust global stream handling within the `speakText` function.
  - Added comprehensive `try-catch` blocks and dedicated error listeners for `stdin` and `stdout` on both the `piper` (TTS generation) and audio player (`aplay`/`paplay`) child processes to gracefully handle `EPIPE` and other stream disruptions without terminating the application.
- **AppImage Symlink Corruption:** Resolved an issue specific to AppImage environments where Piper dependency libraries (like `libonnxruntime.so.1`) were copied as absolute symlinks into the writable `userData` directory, causing them to break on subsequent launches.
  - Rewrote the `getPiperPaths` initialization logic to automatically detect, unlink, and recreate proper relative symlinks for all required shared libraries on application startup.

### Changed
- Incremented base application version to v24 to ensure clean upgrade paths and cache invalidation.
