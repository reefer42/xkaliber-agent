⚔️kaliber Agent v21
Local. Autonomous. Unrestricted.

Xkaliber Agent is a high-performance Electron client for Ollama. It transforms local AI into a "System Agent" with full file access, long-term memory, and real-time web connectivity.

🧠 Neuro-Core (Long-Term Memory)
Smart VRAM Recovery: Automatically unloads idle models if GPU memory is full to ensure memory retrieval never fails.

Selective Learning: The agent autonomously decides which facts or preferences are important enough to save.

Local Persistence: All data is stored in ~/.config/xkaliber-agent/, bypassing browser sandbox limits.

Live UI Feedback: Features a real-time [X MEMS] counter and a flashing [ SAVING... ] indicator.

Full Wipe: A dedicated button instantly clears all session data and the physical vector database.

🛡️ System Control & Security
Bash Execution: Run shell commands directly on your host machine via the agent.

Secure Sudo: A private UI field handles root privileges. It pipes your password safely (sudo -S) without ever saving it to logs or neural memory.

🛠️ The Agentic Toolbelt
Netrunner: Real-time web search via DuckDuckGo (No API keys required).

WhatsApp: Link your account via QR code to send autonomous notifications.

Piper TTS: High-quality, 100% offline Text-to-Speech.

File Manager: Full Read, Write, List, and Delete capabilities.

Multimodal: Drag-and-drop images or text files for instant vision analysis and context.

🚀 Core Features
⚡ 1. Autonomous Agent Mode (System Harness)
Toggle the Sys-Access harness to give your AI "True Agency." The model operates in a continuous loop, autonomously selecting tools to fulfill complex requests:

Shell Autonomy: Execute bash commands and scripts directly.

File Operations: Read, write, delete, and navigate local directory structures.

API Interaction: Make raw HTTP requests to interact with external REST APIs or local services.

Netrunner Mode: Perform live web searches to inject real-time data into the neural stream.

Sensor Fusion: The agent can poll ultrasonic, IR, and touch sensors to make environment-aware decisions.

📱 3. Remote Web Interface (Mobile Optimized)
Turn your host into a localized AI server with the Enable Localhost toggle:


Smart Networking: Automatically detects your local IP and manages port conflicts (defaulting to 18789).

Perfect Mobile UX: Optimized with dynamic viewports (100dvh), anti-zoom scaling, and touch-friendly UI components.

👁️ 4. Multimodal & Vision
Vision Analysis: Use models like Llava or Bakllava to analyze, describe, and extract data from images.


be sure to check out the cli version. after install type xagent to spawn in terminal

🗣️ 5. Offline Comms
Piper TTS: High-speed, high-quality voice synthesis that runs 100% offline.

WhatsApp Bridge: Authenticate via QR code to allow the AI to send notifications and alerts directly to your phone.
