# Xkaliber Agent v37.9.1 // Resource-Optimized Autonomous Assistant

Xkaliber Agent is a modern, dark-themed autonomous agent desktop client built with Electron. It connects seamlessly to local **Ollama** and **LM Studio** neural models and equips them with system-level access, persistent vector memory, web scraping, and multimodal capabilities.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.9.1: Critical Core & UI Hotfixes
- **High-Contrast Chat Bubbles**: Eliminated visual halation (faint text) by redesigning chat bubbles to feature pure black text on light backgrounds, ensuring maximum readability without sacrificing the app's dark theme.
- **History & Agent Logic Restoration**: Fixed the silent agent bug (where the agent ignored prompts due to payload cloning errors) and restored the automated legacy history migration script to safely recover previously wiped chat logs.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.9.0: Enhanced UI Readability
- **Visual Overhaul**: Boosted the contrast, brightness, and font weight of all text in the chat interface. Solved the issue where default text, labels, and system messages appeared faded or "greyed out" against the dark background.
- *Note: Underlying application logic remains identical to v37.8.*

### 🚀 NEW in v37.8: Responsive Offline Browsing
Fixed an issue in the Offline Web Browser where AI-generated websites lacked mobile-responsiveness constraints, causing content and text to bleed off the right side of the screen. The shadow DOM now forcibly injects responsive baseline CSS (like `word-wrap: break-word` and `max-width: 100%`) into all generated pages to ensure they remain perfectly readable within the chat window.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.7: Ollama Offline Browser Compatibility
This update ensures full compatibility with the Offline Web Browser mode when using standard Ollama models. It fixes a bug where Ollama's stream payload variations (`json.response` vs `json.message.content` depending on the API endpoint used) resulted in a blank white Shadow DOM.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.6: Offline Web Browser Mode
A highly requested feature that allows the agent to act as an offline web server. By enabling the **OFFLINE BROWSER** toggle, the agent will stop responding in conversational markdown. Instead, it will dynamically generate a complete, beautifully themed, professional HTML5/CSS webpage to present the information you requested (e.g., generating a full Wiki-style article layout when you research a topic). The generated site is rendered directly in the chat via a secure Shadow DOM, providing a highly immersive browsing experience.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.5: Task Isolation (Ultra-Aggressive Pruning)
This version perfectly aligns with the goal of preventing resource exhaustion during massive coding tasks. When "Resource Saver" is enabled, the agent will now automatically and fully flush its internal chat memory every time you send a new request (keeping only your new instruction and the system prompt). This completely isolates the new task, guaranteeing that 100% of your chosen Context Size is dedicated solely to generating code and analyzing tool outputs, without any bloat from previous conversations.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.4: Hallucination Loop Protection
This update completely eliminates the "endless partial generation" bug caused when LM Studio reaches its maximum context limit mid-generation. The agent now actively monitors the stream's `finish_reason`—if it detects an early cutoff, it instantly halts the autonomous loop and warns the user, rather than endlessly nudging the model to fix broken JSON. Additionally, the Context Guard now uses deep-cache batch pruning to keep LM Studio's prompt evaluation speeds fast over long coding tasks.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.3: LM Studio Context Guard
This version fixes extreme task times in **LM Studio Mode** caused by context window thrashing. The agent now mathematically binds the chat history payload to 75% of your chosen Context Size slider setting, guaranteeing a 25% VRAM headroom for the model's actual response. This prevents LM Studio's internal "rolling window" policy from triggering mid-generation and destroying the prompt cache.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.2: Active Generation Locks
This version fixes mid-task timeouts by completely locking models in VRAM (`keep_alive: -1`) while the agent is executing a multi-turn autonomous loop. Once the task is fully complete, it applies the appropriate memory saver policy, preventing tools that take several minutes (like building or scraping) from causing the model to be prematurely flushed.

### 🚀 NEW in v37.0: Heavy Context Processing
This version resolves the "Model timed out" errors that occurred after VRAM purges by implementing a dynamic Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) handler, allowing large models up to 15 minutes to reload and parse heavy contexts without dropping the connection. It also includes new UI feedback for the warm-up phase.

### 🚀 NEW in v36.4: Predictive Resource Guard
This version introduces a multi-layered memory management system designed to prevent system RAM and VRAM congestion during heavy autonomous workloads (e.g., building applications, large-scale research).

*   **Real-time Resource Monitoring**: The backend now continuously monitors system RAM and process memory, signaling the frontend to adapt before congestion hits.
*   **Adaptive Sliding Window**: Automatically adjusts context length and truncation intensity based on hardware pressure.
*   **Visual Health Status**: Monitor your system's "breathing room" directly from the UI.


*   **Resource Saver Mode**: A new UI toggle that enables aggressive context pruning and message trimming.
*   **Dynamic History Pruning**: Automatically drops intermediate conversation turns and trims massive tool outputs in older messages to keep the context window lean and prevents system RAM bloat.
*   **Autonomous Memory Purge**: The agent can now call the `memory_purge` tool to request a resource cleanup when it detects resource congestion or before starting a massive generation task.
*   **Optimized Keep-Alive**: Automatically reduces model retention time in VRAM when "Resource Saver" is active, ensuring your system stays responsive.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🛡️ Secure Authentication (v36.2)
The agent now includes a built-in security layer to protect your local workspace.
*   **Multi-User Support**: Create separate accounts with unique credentials.
*   **Role-Based Access**: Admins can approve new users and toggle access to sensitive system tools.
*   **Encrypted Credentials**: All passwords are hashed locally using industrial-strength `bcrypt` encryption.

### ⚙️ Asynchronous Background Tasks (v36)
The agent can now natively execute, monitor, and interact with heavy system workloads (like kernel builds or server instances) without blocking or timing out.
*   **Background Processing**: Shell commands can be spawned asynchronously, bypassing default output buffer limits and time constraints.
*   **Log Tailing**: The agent uses `read_process_log` to safely poll the last 50-2000 lines of a running job's `stdout` without blowing up its context window.
*   **Interactive Input**: The `send_input` tool allows the agent to pipe `Y/n` responses or passwords directly into the `stdin` of active background processes, unblocking stalled commands.

### 🌐 Cloudflare Remote Access (v35)
Easily access your local Xkaliber Agent from anywhere.
*   **Automatic Tunnels**: The agent automatically downloads and configures `cloudflared` to generate a secure, ephemeral `.trycloudflare.com` URL on startup.
*   **Standalone Support**: Headless Linux/CLI users can run `node standalone-server.js` to instantly expose the web UI to the public internet securely without the Electron GUI.

### 🤖 Autonomous "Plan-Execute-Verify" Workflow (v34)
The agent now supports a sophisticated multi-turn autonomous loop designed for complex system tasks and research.
*   **Contextual Tool-Chaining**: Instead of linear execution, the agent uses a `task_begin` tool to formally declare a high-level goal and a structured multi-step plan.
*   **Plan-Execute-Verify**: The agent executes steps sequentially, analyzes outputs, and automatically decides the next action. It finishes with a `task_complete` call to summarize results and verify the goal was achieved.
*   **Extended Reasoning**: Supports up to **20 autonomous turns** per user message, providing the depth needed for multi-file audits, deep research, or complex troubleshooting.
*   **System Stability**: Built-in 1-second "cool-down" delays between turns prevent VRAM/CPU exhaustion and system lockups during long reasoning chains.
*   **Live Feedback**: The UI remains interactive and transparent, showing exactly which step the agent is on (`Thinking (Step X/20)...`) without clearing previous context.

### 🧠 Neuro-Core (Intelligent Persistent Memory)
The agent features a robust long-term memory engine powered by local embeddings.
*   **Low-VRAM Optimization (v31.3):** The `all-minilm` embedding model is now strictly forced to run on the **CPU**, preventing VRAM contention and application hangs on systems with limited GPU memory.
*   **Zero-Swap Performance:** By offloading embeddings to the CPU, Xkaliber Agent no longer needs to unload your primary chat model to perform memory searches, resulting in significantly faster and more stable retrieval.
*   **Strict Fact Retention**: The agent is heavily constrained to avoid saving casual conversation. It autonomously decides to use the `save_new_user_fact_only` tool to vectorize and save only *highly important, permanent* user preferences, facts, or project details.
*   **Embeddings Engine**: Utilizes the `all-minilm` model. If Ollama doesn't have it installed, Xkaliber Agent will securely stream and auto-download it on startup.
*   **Main Process Storage**: Memory vector databases are safely written to the user's local disk via IPC.
*   **UI Feedback**: Features a real-time `[X MEMS]` counter and a flashing `[ NEURO-CORE SAVING... ]` indicator.

### 👻 GhostTrace Diagnostics System
*   **Shell Execution**: The agent can run bash commands directly on your host machine to navigate, modify files, and manage the system.
*   **Secure Sudo Injection**: A password field in the UI allows you to provide your sudo password. When the agent attempts a command requiring root privileges, the application dynamically intercepts and pipes your password.
*   **Guard Rails**: Strict system prompts prevent the agent from modifying files or configurations unprompted.

### 🛠️ Autonomous Agent Tools
The UI provides transparent execution logs (`⚡ Exec: function_name`). Available tools include:
*   `run_shell_command`
*   `read_file`, `write_file`, `list_directory`, `delete_file`
*   `save_new_user_fact_only`, `memory_search`
*   `web_search`

### 🌐 Netrunner (Web Access)
*   Equips the agent with real-time web search capabilities using a secure DuckDuckGo HTML scraper (bypassing CORS and API key requirements).
*   **Conversational Synthesis**: Web data is injected securely into the prompt, forcing the LLM to read the data and respond with a natural, flowing, first-person narrative essay, strictly avoiding bulleted lists or markdown tables.

### 🔊 Audio Uplink (TTS) & Multimodal
*   **Piper TTS**: High-quality, offline Text-to-Speech integration (`en_US-lessac-medium`).
*   **📎 Enhanced File Attachments**: Robust file handling with support for images and text documents.
    *   **Vision Integration**: Images are auto-encoded for seamless multimodal analysis with vision models.
    *   **Context Optimization**: Large text files are intelligently truncated to fit context limits, with full access provided via the `read_file` agent tool.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop**: Supports both button-based uploads and direct file dropping into the chat.
