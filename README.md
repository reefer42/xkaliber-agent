⚔️kaliber Agent v22
The Definitive Autonomous Desktop Client for Local Intelligence.

Xkaliber Agent is a modern, dark-themed Electron interface that transforms local Ollama models into fully capable system operators. Beyond simple chat, v21 equips your neural models with persistent vector memory, secure system-level execution, real-time web scraping, and multimodal integration.

🧠 Neuro-Core: Intelligent Persistent Memory
Powered by a "Clawbot-style" long-term memory engine, the agent doesn't just chat—it learns and evolves.

Dynamic VRAM Management: The agent autonomously monitors GPU resources. If VRAM is congested during a memory operation, it will suspend idle models to ensure Neuro-Core remains operational.

Autonomous Learning: Using the mem_store tool, the agent intelligently decides which facts, user preferences, or project details are worth vectorizing for the long term.

Offline Embeddings: Utilizes the all-minilm engine. If missing, Xkaliber Agent securely streams and auto-installs it on the first boot.

Secure Vector Storage: Databases are written directly to ~/.config/xkaliber-agent/ via IPC, bypassing browser sandbox limitations for true persistence.

Real-time Feedback: Monitor your agent's brain with the [X MEMS] counter and the [ NEURO-CORE SAVING... ] status indicator.

🛡️ System Access & Secure Sudo
Xkaliber Agent acts as a bridge between the LLM and your hardware.

Host Execution: Run bash commands directly on your machine to manage files, install packages, or configure services.

Sudo Injection: Provide your password in the secure UI field; the agent dynamically pipes it (echo | sudo -S) for root tasks without ever saving your password to logs or neural memory.

🛠️ The Agentic Toolbelt
View every action in real-time with transparent execution logs (⚡ Exec: function_name).

File Ops: read, write, list, and delete files across the system.

Memory: High-speed vector_search and mem_store.

Netrunner: Real-time web search via a secure DuckDuckGo scraper (No API keys required).

Communication: Autonomous WhatsApp messaging via QR-linked sessions.

Logic: dynamic_schema_generate for creating perfectly structured JSON data.

🔊 Audio & Multimodal Uplink
Piper TTS: Crystal-clear, 100% offline Text-to-Speech (en_US-lessac-medium).

Vision & Context: Drag-and-drop images for vision-model analysis or text files for instant context injection.

🚀 Core Features
⚡ 1. Autonomous Agent Mode (System Harness)
Toggle the Sys-Access harness to give your AI "True Agency." The model operates in a continuous loop, autonomously selecting tools to fulfill complex requests:

Shell Autonomy: Execute bash commands and scripts directly.

File Operations: Read, write, delete, and navigate local directory structures.

API Interaction: Make raw HTTP requests to interact with external REST APIs or local services.

Netrunner Mode: Perform live web searches to inject real-time data into the neural stream.

Sensor Fusion: The agent can poll ultrasonic, IR, and touch sensors to make environment-aware decisions.

📱 3. Remote Web Interface (Mobile Optimized)
Turn your host into a localized AI server with the Enable Localhost toggle:


Smart Networking: Automatically detects your local IP and manages port conflicts (defaulting to 18789).

Perfect Mobile UX: Optimized with dynamic viewports (100dvh), anti-zoom scaling, and touch-friendly UI components.

👁️ 4. Multimodal & Vision
Vision Analysis: Use models like Llava or Bakllava to analyze, describe, and extract data from images.


be sure to check out the cli version. after install type xagent to spawn in terminal

🗣️ 5. Offline Comms
Piper TTS: High-speed, high-quality voice synthesis that runs 100% offline.

WhatsApp Bridge: Authenticate via QR code to allow the AI to send notifications and alerts directly to your phone.
